# Datawrapper Core

This is _Datawrapper Core_, the open source platform that powers the charting tools hosted as free service on [datawrapper.de](https://datawrapper.de).

Most of the functionality in Datawrapper is provided by plugins, [some of which are open source](https://github.com/datawrapper?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=plugin-&type=public&language=) but the majority is not. 

Note that significant parts of the Datawrapper core have been rewritten in Node.js, you can find them in the following repositories:

- [api](https://github.com/datawrapper/api) is our new v3 REST API
- [frontend](https://github.com/datawrapper/frontend) is our new frontend server
- [chart-core](https://github.com/datawrapper/chart-core) is our library that renders all visualizations
- [shared](https://github.com/datawrapper/shared) contains JavaScript utility functions used throughout datawrapper
- [orm](https://github.com/datawrapper/orm) contains our internal database models

Datawrapper was created in 2012 by [Mirko Lorenz](http://www.mirkolorenz.com/), [Nicolas Kayser-Bril](http://nkb.fr) and [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/). Since 2014 it is developed by [Datawrapper GmbH](https://www.datawrapper.de/about-us/).

Datawrapper has in the past received funding by [ABZV](http://www.abzv.de/).
