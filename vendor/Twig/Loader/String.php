/**
 * Loads a template from a string.
 *
 * This loader should only be used for unit testing as it has many limitations
 * (for instance, the include or extends tag does not make any sense for a string
 * loader).
 *
 * When using this loader with a cache mechanism, you should know that a new cache
 * key is generated each time a template content "changes" (the cache key being the
 * source code of the template). If you don't want to see your cache grows out of
 * control, you need to take care of clearing the old cache file by yourself.
